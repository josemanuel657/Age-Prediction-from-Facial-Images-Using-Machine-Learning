# Age-Prediction-from-Facial-Images-Using-Machine-Learning
This Project predicts age from UTKFace images using preprocessing (grayscale, PCA) and models like Random Forest, SVR, and optimized MLP. SHAP and PCA enhance interpretability by connecting features to age. Balances accuracy and efficiency, making it practical for age estimation in resource-limited environments.
